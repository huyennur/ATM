# ATM

THIS IS AN ATM SIMULATION.

In order to run this project, you need to install JAVA, JAVAFX and SCENE BUILDER.
While adding all the lib into this project, don't forget to add VM options in Edit Configurations: 

    --module-path
    "source path to JAVAFX lib"
    --add-modules
    javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
    
NOTE: 
  Because I build this program on Intelij MACOS so you should be carefull to check out the source path correctly in every file in this project.
